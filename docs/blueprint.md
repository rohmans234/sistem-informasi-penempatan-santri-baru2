## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to convey trust, security, and tradition, which resonates with the Pondok Modern Darussalam Gontor's values.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Yellow-Amber (#FFAB40), which will be used sparingly to highlight interactive elements, calls to action, and important notifications. It provides a warm contrast to the primary.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet warm and readable appearance across the platform.
- Use simple, professional icons for navigation and data representation, maintaining a clean and efficient user interface.
- Maintain a clear, structured layout with intuitive navigation to ensure ease of use for administrators and santri.
- Employ subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without distracting from core functionality.
